  // ================================================================ market
  // Phase 2 of the content plan: learn first, scale second.
  //   * product-market fit (0-100) multiplies every revenue gain, pulls churn
  //     towards its own level and, above 60, adds word of mouth
  //   * PMF starts hidden: talking to customers reveals it and deals insight
  //     cards; building on an insight raises it, building on a hunch is a gamble
  //   * experiments test one hypothesis a week; a matching insight improves the odds
  //   * pivot: a new PMF roll for a big cut in revenue and clarity
  //   * competitors grow and act: copy features, raise rounds, cut prices
  //   * sector rules: fintech licence, marketplace liquidity, edtech seasons,
  //     health trust, SaaS retention
  // Engine methods (talkToCustomers, runExperiment, buildProduct, pivot) are
  // added to StartupEngine so the UI and the balance bot use the same code.
  // shares App's scope (see economy.js) plus economy's helpers.
